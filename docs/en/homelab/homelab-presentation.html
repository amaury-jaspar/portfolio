				<h1>My Home Lab</h1>

				<p>
					Welcome to my "blog" dedicated to my home lab setup. This is a place where I'll be discussing my home setup (workstation, servers, automation...) 
					and how I chose to self-host the services I use everyday. 	
				</p>

				<h2>References and ressources</h2>

				<p>
					I you're interested in self-hosting, or just want to get ideas for home projects, I would recommend you check those links :
				</p>

				<ul>
					<li><a href="https://selfhosted.show/">Self-Hosted by Jupiter Broadcast</a></li>
					<li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/datahoarder">The DataHoarder subreddit</a></li>
					<li><a href="https://level1techs.com/">The level1tech community and youtube channel</a></li>
				</ul>

				<h2>The Hardware</h2>

				<p>
					If you want to build a homelab, you'll need hardware. Keep in mind that praticly anything can qualify as a "homelab", 
					a raspberry- pi sitting in a corner of a room can go a long way depending on your use case.
